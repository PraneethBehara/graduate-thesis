Exploration of an apriori unknown environment by a mobile robot requires it to identify its next best position in the partially explored region which yields the maximum information. This thesis work will broadly answer two questions. Firstly, how can a robot perform an autonomous exploration if given a stereo vision and secondly given multiple such robots, how can they collaborate with minimal communication to efficiently explore an indoor environment using Wi-Fi as an additional sensor. 
To begin we describe the process of exploring frontiers which separate the explored from the uncharted regions, incorporating the method of maximizing the information gained for every frontier to be visited next. We then introduce a novel coverage strategy which combines the previous technique of frontier based exploration to using Wi-Fi signal strengths from surrounding access points. This approach involves clustering of environment without any prior information about it and demonstrate it to be complete i.e completely explore any given environment unlike most traditional coverage strategies which are either incomplete or probabilistically complete. Wi-Coverage was designed such that the robot explores in a systematic way and no prior access to the map is required. It also supports multiple robot coordination with minimum communication possible.

Robot Operating System (ROS) is used for implementation of frontier exploration and engineering issues faced are also discussed in detail. Gazebo simulator is used for simulating robots and Wi-Fi powered environments. Simulation results of time taken for full coverage and robot trajectories are obtained for the proposed strategy and are compared with best available form of frontier exploration which use optimal information gain policy.

I am very fortunate in having the support and encouragement of many people during my masters. First of all I would like to thank my co-advisor Karthik for giving me this opportunity and sharing his invaluable research insights and ideas. I also thank my co-advisor Nicholas Mastronarde for giving me valuable suggestions and academic support without which this work would not have been possible.

\hspace{1.5em} It has been hugely rewarding for being a part of Distributed Robotics and Networked Embedded Systems group: thanks everyone, past and present, for all the discussions, arguments and fun we had together! Each of you in your own way created a special place to work and learn. To Charu, I am grateful for his contributions, our research and for the countless interesting and stimulating conversations. I would also like to thank Zakieh for helping me with her technical expertise, whenever I needed it. Chen, Yifang made the lab a fun place to be and always provided intelligent inputs in the discussions.

\hspace{1.5em} Special thanks also go to my roommates, past and present, Kashyap Chitta, Sri Sadhan, Vamsi Eranki, Abhilash Gandla, Lokesh Boddu, Bodhi Rudra and Srinivas Addula for their encouragement and support, especially for the much needed dinner supplies.

\hspace{1.5em} Most of all, I am grateful to my family that always stood by me, helping me pursue my passion and guiding me to a better tomorrow.
